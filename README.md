Hi there. My name is Zen, I'm the developer of this bot.
Originally, this was created for the Twokinds server. I found that the bot was not well used by anyone but the mods, and so I killed it.
Recently, a friend made a private server and wanted something like the Maeve bot from the Twokinds Group Chat discord bot.
Maddie was originally designed to be just that, I wanted to make something like that.
So I decided to run this again. This will not be reintroduced into the Twokinds discord unless I am explicitly contacted for such purposes.

This Discord bot is specifically designed for the Twokinds discord, and may seem odd or not function properly in other guilds, despite some of the error catching I have programmed.

The only reason this may work in other guilds is due to the fact that I have put safety nets, incase the bot doesn't have those permissions or is not in the specific guild, since this bot is in personal testing guilds. Some features may never be used, as they are soley for myself to learn more of discord.js.

~~I intend on building a public bot called Enjoyatles, which will be an all around bot, in attempt to make servers more enjoyable. You can check out Enjoyatle's repository with the link below, once I actually get started on it.~~ - never decided to do this :P
