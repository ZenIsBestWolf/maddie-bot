Maddie Bot is a private and server specific discord.js bot.

This Discord bot is specifically designed for the Twokinds discord, and may seem odd or not function properly in other guilds, despite some of the error catching I have programmed.

The only reason this may work in other guilds is due to the fact that I have put safety nets, incase the bot doesn't have those permissions or is not in the specific guild, since this bot is in personal testing guilds. Some features may never be used, as they are soley for myself to learn more of discord.js.

~~I intend on building a public bot called Enjoyatles, which will be an all around bot, in attempt to make servers more enjoyable. You can check out Enjoyatle's repository with the link below, once I actually get started on it.~~ - never decided to do this :P
